# Lemmy Fast Post

Allows you to command/ctrl + enter within the text area to submit a comment. Thats all

## Installation

You'll need a UserScript manager. I like [ViolentMonkey](violentmonkey.github.io/)

## Configuration

Lemmy instances can have `any` url, so I don't ship this script with URLs configured. In your script manager, you'll need to add overrides for what pages it should match on. In ViolentMonkey, when viewing the script, the overrides are on the `Settings` page, under the `@match` rules.
Add your instance like this: `https://lemdro.id/*`
